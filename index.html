<h1 style="color:blue;">What I did over Winter Break</h1>

<p title="Not Mynu">My name is Minu Aktar.</p>
<p>I am majoring Graphic Design and minoring in Business.</p>
<p>During this winter break, I went to North Carolina to celebrate Christmas with the rest of my family.<br><br>
The day before Christmas, I spent with my nephew and niece,
and we went to the "Accidental Artist" place and painted some potteries.</p>

<p>We came back to Philadelphia.
I updated my website with a rustic wedding category since I designed my cousin's wedding favors & gifts last summer.</p>
<p><a href="https://aktardesigns.com/rustic-wedding-favors-gifts">Visit Rustic Wedding Design</a></p>
<p> Then I had covid right before school started. So I took the last couple of days to rest and feel better.</p>
